# WeeklyReport

During my internship as a project engineer intern, I had to send out a few weekly reports. With the use of VBscript and power BI, I was able to update data and create a new report at the simple click of a button, saving around 30-45 minutes of formatting and updates each week. I also gave this code to the intern that would uphold these tasks in the following terms after my departure.

The part of the code that created an outlook email with the corresponding report was used in other reports as well. In total, including this particular example weekly report, these automated tasks saved me around 2h or work every week, which allowed me more time to follow up with other

This code used HTML to input data in the outlook email item. The desired cells would then be converted to an HTML table before being put in the email's body.

Here is an example of the report produced by this example file:
